# PORTING.md — the Python/C++ → Rust map

Auditability index: for each Rust module, the upstream reference-software source it ports and
the parity test that gates it. Upstream is the JPEG AI reference software at commit `b9e573f`
(`https://gitlab.com/wg1/jpeg-ai/jpeg-ai-reference-software`), referred to below as `ref/`.

A row is only marked **ported** when the code is called from the main path and a parity test
against reference-produced data passes. "stub" and "partial" mean what they say.

| Rust module | Upstream source | Status | Parity gate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `bitio` | `entropy_coding/bits_coders.py`, `binarizers.py`, `cpp_exts/direct/` | ported (reader + writer, ue/se) | unit tests (known codewords, round trips); exercised by every header test once headers land |
| `container` | `bitstream_structure/{layouts_def,substream,bitstream_structure,aemem}.py` | ported: marker split, region split (independent + dependent), thread split, writer | unit round trips only so far; no reference-stream gate yet |
| `mans::tables` | `lib_wrappers/mans/utils.py`, `ec_lib_mans.py::init_quant_params` | ported, integer-only | `mans::tables::tests::tables_match_reference` (FNV-1a of the reference-built encode/decode/state-map tables) |
| `mans::decoder` | `cpp_exts/mans/decompressor.{h,cpp}` | ported: residual + z, 1..16 threads (threads run sequentially for now) | `tests/mans_vectors.rs`: decodes payloads written by the reference C++ `ANSEncoder` |
| `mans::encoder` | `cpp_exts/mans/compressor.{h,cpp}` | ported: residual + z, 1..16 threads | `tests/mans_vectors.rs`: output bytes and thread sizes equal the reference's |
| `weights` | `torch.load` of `models/**/*.pth` (no upstream source: replaces PyTorch's unpickler) | ported: stored-ZIP reader (zip64 aware), data-only pickle interpreter, lazy strided tensor materialisation | `tests/weights_ref.rs` (`reference-tests` feature): tensor hashes equal `torch.load`'s for int8/int32/int64/bool/f32 tensors; all 68 upstream checkpoints parse |
| `header` | `coding_engine.py`, `colour_transformation.py`, `multitools/engine.py`, `ccs_sgmm_tool.py`, `quantization.py`, `sep_chan_tool.py`, `skip_mode.py`, `res_var_scale.py`, `tiling.py`, `quality_map.py`, `rdi.py` (header functions only) | partial: PIH complete (parse + write + profile/level conformance); RDI complete; TON: LSBS flags only, **a stream enabling any of the 4 post-filters is rejected as `Unsupported`** (their parameter syntax is not ported); UDI not ported | `header::tests`: two reference-encoder PIH payloads parse to the values `scripts/bitstream_probe.py` prints and re-serialise byte-identically |

Not started: z/residual substream decode, hyper-scale decoder, quantizer
tools (gain unit, RVS, quality map), skip mode, tiling/regions, hyper decoder, MCM context model,
synthesis transforms (SOP/BOP/HOP), post-filters (EFE linear/nonlinear, eICCI, LEF), colour
processing, image IO, the whole encoder side above the entropy coder, CLI, benchmarks.

## Deliberate divergences from the reference

- **Sigma index above 31.** The reference clamps the sigma index to `[0, 34]`
  (`sigma_quant_level = 35`) but its C++ coder only has 32 distributions and indexes past the end
  of its tables for 32..34 (undefined behaviour). `mans` clamps to 31 instead. Whether real streams
  ever reach 32 is not yet measured.
- **Container strictness.** The reference reader skips unknown two-byte words and spins forever on
  a truncated file. `container::Codestream::parse` requires SOC, known markers, PIH first, and EOC.
- **`log2_num_threads_q_minus1` width.** The reference encoder writes it with 2 bits, its decoder
  reads 1 (so the reference cannot decode its own multi-threaded quality maps). `header` uses
  2 bits, like the `z` and residual thread fields.
- **Corrupt ANS payloads.** Where the C++ decoder would read in front of its buffer, `mans`
  reports `Error::InvalidData`.

## Reference environment

The reference runs locally from `~/work/zen/jpeg-ai-reference-software` (see `CLAUDE.md` for
the environment recipe). Reference bitstreams, decoded images and intermediate tensor dumps
used by the parity tests live under `/mnt/v/output/zenjpegai/reference/`; they are produced by
`scripts/make_reference_vectors.sh` and are not committed (size).
